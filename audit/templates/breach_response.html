            Then, you can insert all details about the incident response plan. In this case, incident response is
            helped by <a href="www.attack-prophecy.it">Attack Prophecy</a>, thanks to its virtual patching mechanism that also covers zero-day (never-before-seen)
            attacks that may lead to data breaches.
            {% endblocktrans %}
        </p>
        <p>{% blocktrans %}Please note that in general, for each data breach detection technique,
            you should specify:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How breach response is possible</strong>: how data breaches can be effectively handled.
                    This phase usually prefigures a well-suited recovery plan, and systems such as Attack Prophecy, capable to provide protection against <em>unexpected</em> behavior of your applications and users.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Breach Notification</strong>: notification procedures to the involved parties, including supervisory authorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Residual risk (of inadequate/missing response to data breaches)</strong>: that
            is, an evaluation of the residual risk of <em>not responding properly</em> to data breaches given the specific incident response plan.
            This should be the output of a detailed risk analysis that evaluates likelihood and impact of data breaches for the considered data audit
            (in this case, identity documents) and incident response plan.
            </ul>

            {% blocktrans %}In this example, we create an incident response plan that employs <strong>Attack Prophecy</strong> to create
            virtual patches if intrusive events are detected.
            Additionaly, an (encrypted) backup of Virtual Machines and Data is used for recovery/investigation purposes.

            Finally, a predefined template of what information include in data breach notifications has been prepared (see, e.g., Article 33(3)).
            We associate the incident response plan to the Data Audit <strong>Identity Documents</strong>.
            Please note that many other data audits can be associated with the same incident response plan, e.g.,
            if the plan covers other applications that handle different data,
            or the same web application that is covered by the plan handles other data.
